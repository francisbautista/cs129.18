    ">Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world. It account for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an X-ray or felt as a lump.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset below is a sample of UCI's breast cancer dataset. It includes columns that describe readings of breast cancer scans and their tags on whether they were classified as malignant or not. Build a model that can automatically classify using the columns available.\n",
